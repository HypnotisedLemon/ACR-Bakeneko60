The design is based around Bakeneko60 PCB outline from KKatano's Bakeneko60 [repository](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60).
The daughterboard placement is upside down to avoid any interference with PCB, keep the height minimum and for initial testing. Once I have daughterboard in hand, I will update the design if needed.
You can download the DXF's and edit it to your own liking or according to thickness of acrylic you have available. Dont forget to adjust the feet cutouts accordingly.
AGAIN, I have NOT tested the design, so if you want to get it manufactured before that, it it all on YOU.
