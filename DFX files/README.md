The design is based around Bakeneko60 PCB outline from KKatano's Bakeneko60 [repository](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60).
The daughterboard placement is at the bottom of the Layer 1 to avoid interference with PCB and keep thickness of acrylic consistent. I have included a sketch of how it will be mounted. 
Dimensions of USB C connector and daughterboard are taken from datasheet and C3 aughterboard drawings.
You can download the DXF's and edit it to your own liking or according to thickness of acrylic you have available. Dont forget to adjust the feet cutouts accordingly.
AGAIN, I have NOT tested the design, so if you want to get it manufactured before that, it it all on YOU.
