# ACR-Bakeneko60
Stacked acrylic case for Bakeneko60 PCB (KKatano).
Another fine (or not) edition to my stacked acrylic case designs born out of same old cheapskate and design tinkering self.
This case is designed around PCB outline found in Bakeneko60's [repository](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60).
Current state of the design is in very early stage. Once manufactured and tested, I will update it accordingly. 
If you decide to go with the design before I can test it, do it on your own risk. Me no take responsibility for any mishaps.
