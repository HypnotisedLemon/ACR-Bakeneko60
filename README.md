# ACR-Bakeneko60
Stacked acrylic case for Bakeneko60 (KKatano).
Another fine (or not) edition to my stacked acrylic case designs born out of same old cheapskate and design tinkering self.
This case is designed around PCB outline found in Bakeneko60's [repository](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60).
I have yet to test this design, so if you decide to have a go with it, I am not responsible for any issues you encounte.
